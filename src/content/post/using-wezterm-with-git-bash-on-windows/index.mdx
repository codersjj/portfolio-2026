If you are developing on Windows, you've probably used **Git Bash** at some point. While it works fine, the default Git Bash window feels outdated compared to modern terminals.

This is where **WezTerm** comes in.

WezTerm is a modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that works beautifully on Windows. In this post, I'll show how I set up **WezTerm to run Git Bash by default**, giving me a much better terminal experience on Windows.

## Why WezTerm?

WezTerm is a cross-platform terminal emulator written in **Rust**, and it offers a lot of features that make it stand out:

- GPU-accelerated rendering for smooth performance
- Tabs and split panes out of the box
- Highly customizable via **Lua configuration**
- Excellent font and color scheme support
- Works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux

If you enjoy tools like iTerm2 or Alacritty, WezTerm feels right at home—especially on Windows.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

### 1. Git for Windows

Git Bash comes with **Git for Windows**.
The Bash executable is usually located at:

```text
C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe
```

If Git is already installed, you're good to go.

### 2. WezTerm

You can install WezTerm in several ways:

- Using `winget`
- Downloading the installer from the official website

Installation guide: [https://wezterm.org/install/windows.html](https://wezterm.org/install/windows.html)

---

## Creating the WezTerm Configuration

WezTerm is configured using a Lua file called `.wezterm.lua`.

Create the file here:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.wezterm.lua
```

Then add the following configuration:

```lua
local wezterm = require("wezterm")

local config = wezterm.config_builder()

-- Initial window size
config.initial_cols = 128
config.initial_rows = 28

-- Appearance
config.font_size = 11
config.color_scheme = "Material Darker (base16)"

-- Use Git Bash as the default shell
config.default_prog = {
  "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
  "--login",
  "-i"
}

return config
```

This tells WezTerm to launch **Git Bash** instead of `cmd.exe` or PowerShell when it starts.

> If Git is installed in a different directory on your machine, make sure to update the path accordingly.

---

## Launching WezTerm

Once the configuration file is saved:

* If WezTerm is already running, it will **reload the config automatically**
* Otherwise, just start WezTerm normally

You should now see Git Bash running inside WezTerm, with all the benefits of a modern terminal.

---

## Customizing the Experience

One of the best parts of WezTerm is how easy it is to customize.

### Changing Color Schemes

WezTerm ships with many built-in color schemes.
You can browse them here: [https://wezterm.org/colorschemes/index.html](https://wezterm.org/colorschemes/index.html)

To switch themes, simply update:

```lua
config.color_scheme = "Gruvbox Dark"
```

### Fonts

You can also customize the font:

```lua
config.font = wezterm.font("JetBrains Mono")
```

This makes a huge difference for readability, especially during long coding sessions.

## Tips and Ideas

* Use tabs and split panes to manage multiple projects at once
* Combine WezTerm with **WSL** for Linux-based workflows
* Take advantage of Lua to create dynamic or context-aware configs
* Customize key bindings to match your habits

WezTerm can be as simple or as powerful as you want it to be.

---

## Conclusion

By combining **WezTerm** with **Git Bash**, you get:

✅ A modern terminal experience on Windows

✅ Better performance and visuals

✅ A highly customizable setup that grows with you

If you spend a lot of time in the terminal, this setup is absolutely worth it. Once you get used to WezTerm, it's hard to go back.

Happy hacking 🚀
