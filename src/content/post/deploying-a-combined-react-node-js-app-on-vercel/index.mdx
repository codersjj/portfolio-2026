{/* # Deploying a Combined React + Node.js App on Vercel (for Small to Medium Projects) */}

> **Who this guide is for**
>
> This article is intended for intermediate frontend or full-stack developers who want a **simple, unified deployment** for a React + Node.js application (such as side projects, MVPs, or internal tools).
> It is **not** meant as a best-practice architecture for large-scale production systems.

---

Deploying a React frontend and a Node.js backend together on Vercel can be confusing at first—especially when you want everything in a single repository and a single deployment.

In this guide, we'll walk through a **practical, working setup** that:

- Uses **Vite + React** for the frontend
- Uses **Express** for the backend
- Deploys everything through **Vercel**
- Keeps the developer experience simple and predictable

This approach trades some architectural purity for **clarity and convenience**, which is often the right choice for small to medium projects.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** `20.19+` or `22.12+`
  Vite currently requires these versions.
- A **Vercel account**
- Basic familiarity with:
  - React
  - Node.js / Express
  - npm scripts

---

## Project Structure

We'll assume the following monorepo structure:

```text
your-project-name/
├── api/
│   └── index.js
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── server.js
│   │   └── config/
│   │       └── env.js
│   ├── .env
│   └── package.json
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.tsx
│   │   └── main.tsx
│   ├── vite.config.ts
│   └── package.json
├── vercel.json
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- **frontend/**: React + Vite application
- **backend/**: Express server
- **api/**: Vercel Function entry point
- **vercel.json**: Vercel deployment configuration

---

## Backend: Express Server Setup

### `backend/src/server.js`

```js
import express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { ENV } from "./config/env.js";

const projectRoot = path.resolve();

const app = express();

// define an API endpoint
app.get("/api/health", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Success" });
});

// make our app ready for deployment
if (ENV.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  // Serve the static files from the React app
  app.use(express.static(path.join(projectRoot, "../frontend/dist")));

  // Handle requests by serving the index.html file for all other routes
  app.get("/{*any}", (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(projectRoot, "../frontend/dist/index.html"));
  });
}

// Starts the HTTP server listening for connections.
app.listen(ENV.PORT, () => console.log("Server is up and running"));
```

This server:

- Exposes a simple API endpoint
- Serves the built React app in production

---

### Environment Configuration

#### `backend/src/config/env.js`

```js
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

export const ENV = {
  NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV || "development",
  PORT: parseInt(process.env.PORT || "3000", 10),
};
```

#### `backend/.env`

```env
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### `backend/package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js"
  }
}
```

---

## Frontend: Build with Vite

From the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure your `package.json` contains:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build"
  }
}
```

This produces a `dist/` directory, which will later be served by Express.

---

## Root `package.json` Scripts

At the project root:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start": "npm run start --prefix backend"
  }
}
```

This allows Vercel to:

- Install dependencies for both apps
- Build the frontend
- Start the backend

---

## Vercel Configuration

### `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/"
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm install --prefix backend --production=false && npm install --prefix frontend --production=false && npm run build --prefix frontend"
}
```

Vercel requires backend code to live under an `api/` directory (see: [https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#description](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#description)).

### `api/index.js`

```js
import "../backend/src/server.js";
```

Since we're using ES modules, add this to the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

---

## Deploying with Vercel CLI

```bash
pnpm i -g vercel
vercel login

# Deploy with Environment Variables
vercel -e NODE_ENV=production -e PORT=3000

# Deploy to production with Environment Variables
vercel --prod -e NODE_ENV=production -e PORT=3000
```

After deployment, Vercel will provide a public URL.

---

## Verifying the Deployment

- Frontend: `https://your-domain.vercel.app`
- Backend: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`

Both should work from the same domain.

---

## Why This Approach?

This setup is intentionally **simple**:

- Single repository
- Single deployment
- Familiar Express server

It works well for:

- MVPs
- Side projects
- Internal tools

However, for large-scale or high-traffic systems, you should consider:

- Separate frontend and backend deployments
- Native Vercel Serverless Functions
- Frameworks like Next.js

---

## Conclusion

Deploying a combined React and Node.js app on Vercel doesn't have to be complicated.

While this approach isn't perfect for every scenario, it provides a **clear, maintainable, and beginner-friendly** deployment strategy for many real-world projects.

If you understand the trade-offs, it can be a very effective solution.
